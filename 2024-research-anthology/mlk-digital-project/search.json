Our collection included letters, declassified FBI memos, speech recordings, photos, and more. The data is stored in two databases hosted on DBtextworks and FileMaker Pro. By sifting through correspondence from various organizations across different states and areas of focus, we created a cohesive timeline of Dr. King’s activities in 1963 and the movements he led for the eighth volume. Essentially, we are able to chronologize Dr. King’s activities almost daily. The most critical documents are selected for publication after a group discussion and voting.\n  \n  \n  \n  Fig. 1. The left shows physical files and the application InMagic DB/Textworks. The right, connected by an arrow, shows a partial timeline describing Dr. King’s activities in January 1960.\n  \n  \n  In addition to what we learned from the documents procured by the institute, I further supplemented this era of Dr. King’s life by conducting extensive background research to provide a more comprehensive picture of the civil rights movement in the 1960s. To ensure our volumes are as thorough as possible, we identified specific gaps in knowledge raised by correspondences selected for Volume VIII. I researched newspapers, interviews, and other sources to address these gaps with detailed and accurate context. I also reached out to civil rights organizations such as AFL-CIO and university archives to expand our document collection and network.\n  \n  \n  \n  Fig. 2.

The background features a heat map composed of words frequently used in his speeches.\n  \n  \n  The institute is working to digitize its previously physical volumes to enhance accessibility. I maintained our website and contributed to webpage developments as we digitized the series. Given the volume of textual data we have compiled, I plan to create interactive offerings for students, teachers, and researchers to engage with and visualize Dr. King’s legacy after the publication of the newest volume. These projects include timelines featuring interactive maps of major events in Dr. King’s life for students seeking a broad overview of Dr. King’s life and activism; another visual tool aims to track Dr. King’s rhetorical strategies, including examples of his speeches and sermons that highlight shifts in his oratory style. These projects will provide students, teachers, and researchers with a deeper and more engaging understanding of Dr. King’s legacy at a time when we may need his wisdom."
