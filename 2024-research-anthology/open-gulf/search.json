This summer, one of my primary tasks was to verify the accuracy of our existing Lorimer geographic dataset. To accurately analyze and map the historical regions documented in the Gazetteer, I utilized AntConc, a freeware toolkit for text analysis, to scan the text files, identify key locations, and ensure that the descriptions aligned with our existing dataset.\n  \n  \n  \n  Fig. 1. A Glimpse into “Iraq” through the lens of AntConc Software, exploring geographical and etymological references in the Ottoman and British contexts.\n  \n  \n  Following the textual analysis, I assigned each identified region, city, or area a unique Geographical ID using GeoNames, a global geographical database containing over eleven million place names. After accumulating the GeoNames IDs, I employed OpenRefine, a powerful open-source tool for managing unstructured data, to submit URLs to web-based Geocoding APIs. This process augmented our dataset with precise latitude and longitude coordinates. Finally, using the extracted coordinate data, I created a detailed map of the identified locations within the Bahrain region of our dataset, utilizing ArcGIS Online or Pro.\n  \n  \n  \n  Fig. 2. Mapping the Bahrain Region using ArcGIS Pro, based on geocoded coordinates extracted from GeoNames and refined through OpenRefine.\n  \n  \n  Throughout the summer, my work within OpenGulf primarily focused on data manipulation, mapping Gulf spaces, and conducting textual analysis of imperial records using ArcGIS and QGIS. One of my key contributions has been the creation of a series of heat concentration maps based on data extracted from the Gazetteer and its appendix, with a particular emphasis on Iraq due to the granularity of the data available for this region. These maps illustrate the intensity of mentions of religious communities within specific areas, highlighting Baghdad as a central hub of administration and trade, the prominence of Basra as a port connecting Iraq to global markets, and the significance of the southern regions for agriculture, particularly in the cultivation of date palms. Additionally, the dispersal of smaller heat spots reflects the presence of numerous smaller communities that were integral to local economies or served as strategic routes during this period.\n  \n  \n  \n  Fig. 3.
