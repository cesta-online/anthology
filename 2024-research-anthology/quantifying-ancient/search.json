The historical data for this project come primarily from the Inventory of the Ancient Associations and the Ghent Database of Roman Guilds, covering a large geography ranging from Italy in the West to the further reaches of the Near East. These records, however, are organized in traditional index-card format to facilitate qualitative research, hence not amenable to any analytical, geospatial, or statistical analysis. Therefore, the first phase of the project focused on revising and re-coding the data collated from different databases to achieve more consistency, locating the points of data scarcity, creating additional variables for statistical and network analysis, and adding GIS information for spatial analysis.\n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n          Project Members\n        \n        \n          \n            Project Member\n          \n          \n            Designation\n          \n          \n            ORCID\n          \n        \n            \n          \n            James Macksoud\n          \n          \n            PhD Candidate in Classics\n          \n          0000-0000-0000-0000\n        \n            \n          \n            Umit Ozturk\n          \n          \n            PhD Candidate in Classics\n          \n          0000-0000-0000-0000\n        \n            \n          \n            Myan Ngo\n          \n          \n            Intern - Summer, 2024\n          \n          0000-0000-0000-0000\n        \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n  \n  Mapping Patterns in Ancient Associations: Dataset Enhancements and Visualization with R\n  \n  Myan Ngo\n  \n  Over the second half of the summer quarter, I worked to contribute to the Quantifying Ancient Associations project by adding to and revising their dataset. Then, I utilized their dataset to create visualizations, using R, to get a better understanding of ancient associations and the dataset.\n  \n  \n  \n  Figure 1. This shows how many associations there were over time for every region (included in the dataset). From 1st to 2nd/3rd century AD there’s a spike of associations.\n  \n  \n  The main dataset of this project was mostly populated by the time I started to work on it. The historical data for this project comes primarily from the Inventory of the Ancient Associations and the Ghent Database of Roman Guilds, covering a large geography ranging from Italy in the West to the further reaches of the Near East. I added the remaining 250 entries using the catalog entries from the Copenhagen Inventory. These entries consisted of associations from the Black Sea Region, Central Greece, Western Greece, Cyprus, East Asian Minor, Libya, and the Peloponnese (with Adjacent Islands). Afterward, I revised past entries in the dataset in random samples of 10. Other than revising a diverse set of entries, the goal of randomly sampling the entries was to see where the database’s “weaknesses” were. The “weaknesses” I was looking for were focused on structural issues, such as the strictness of binary dimensions. For example, there is a column, “Honors,” that represents whether or not the association honors its own members, while there’s another column, “Interaction - Honors,” that represents whether or not the association honors non-members. Many of the association catalogs were unclear if the honor was bestowed to a member or non-member. As a result, the dataset entries were inconsistent for these associations (due to different editor interpretations). I identified this issue, and Umit and James are currently working on a way to standardize the catalog interpretations.\n  \n  \n  \n  Figure 2. This graph shows the scaled revenue counts (# of certain revenue type / total revenue type #) for each region. It can be seen that interest and benefaction are the two most popular revenue types across the board.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  Figure 3. This graph shows the top 10 officer/leader names for all the associations.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  Figure 4. This graph shows the single most popular officer/leader names by region. It seems that “hiereus” is still the most popular across most regions.\n  \n  \n  After I populated and revised the dataset, I then started to work on visualizations using the ggplot package in R. There wasn’t a specific goal/aspect we were trying to show. Instead, I was tasked with creating as many visualizations as I could. These visualizations can provide a clearer overview of patterns in ancient associations."
