    "text": "Methods\n  To ensure that the data I was using to carry out textual analysis was as comprehensive as possible, I first updated the entries of plague in our database by using different words to find entries on plague in German texts of the era. For example, the prior database entries had been found using the keyword entry ‘Pest’ and ‘Pestilenz,’ German words for ‘plague’. However, I thought I might find more entries if I used the words ‘Krankheit’ (sickness) and ‘erkrant’ (to fall ill), read the entries, and then determine if they were likely referring to the plague. To do this, I used Gateway-Bayern.de, an archival website affiliated with the Bavarian Directory. After updating the database, I then turned to translating the hundreds of entries in our database. This posed some challenges because automated transcription and translation services, such as Transkribus, were not particularly accurate. Therefore, I manually translated the entries in Word.\n  \n  \n  \n  Word bubble of words associated with pestilenz. Interestingly, the words ‘Krieg’ (war), ‘Schaden’ (damage), ‘gefährlich’ (dangerous), ‘heimlich’ (secretive), and ‘sterben’ (dying) were more often associated with ‘plague’ than any religious terms.\n  \n  \n  Once I had finished translating the entries, I created .csv files in order to input them into Palladio, a Stanford-made data visualization software. I used this software to create the graphs seen below. Data entry was particularly helpful because it enabled me to develop a conceptual understanding of periods of particularly high fear, intolerance, or suffering. Using these data, I was able to develop word and phrase bubbles that revealed words associated more frequently with ‘Pestilenz’. Interestingly, the words ‘Krieg’ (war), ‘Schaden’ (damage), ‘gefährlich’ (dangerous), ‘heimlich’ (secretive), and ‘sterben’ (dying) were more often associated with ‘plague’ than any religious terms. This may suggest that people feared the physical realities of plagues more than the possibility that they were divine punishment. Furthermore, the words for Christ and Christians (‘Christus’ and ‘Christen’) are on the outermost ring of words, suggesting they were least frequently used when discussing plagues and, by extension, that people associated ‘plague’ more with war than with God. Strikingly, the phrases placed closest to each other all reference medicine, doctors, or healing in some way, suggesting that doctors occupied a relatively powerful position during plague-ridden years.\n  \n  \n  \n  Phrases that are more similar or closely associated are located closer together on this visualization. Notice that the phrases placed closest to each other all reference medicine, doctors, or healing in some way, suggesting that doctors occupied a relatively powerful position during plague-ridden years."
