This project is important because it has the potential to transform the way that English Language Arts are taught in the classroom. We generate tools like word clouds and bar graphs, and then investigate how teachers can use these visualizations to help students engage with and evaluate stories, authorial choices, and data.\n  My work has involved using GitHub to access existing coding frameworks and create data visualizations for a variety of new texts. The next phase involves bringing these visualizations into the classroom, potentially through a dedicated website for students or a tool specifically designed for teachers. At the beginning of August, my team presented this work in Redwood City to a group of Bay Area teachers and gathered feedback for how these visualizations can best support ELA literacy in the classroom!\n  \n  \n  \n  Fig. 1.

Barchart Visualization\n  \n  \n  In a second component of the project, we’re expanding the scope of ELA by examining trends in how English is represented in high school and post-secondary course descriptions and syllabi. We’ve analyzed what texts and writing products teachers expect students to engage with, exploring variations by state, geographical region, and institution type. This work involved collecting syllabi and identifying authors of hundreds of common texts. I also built a webscraper utilizing Selenium to more efficiently parse PDF’s and hone in on the most common novels in the classroom. I put all this data in a spreadsheet and used SQL to create a comprehensive map of the dataset.\n  \n  \n  \n  Fig. 3. This figure is a map that compares the novels used in college ELA courses compared to high school courses. Novels that are used in both college and high school courses, like Homer’s Oddysey, represented in between the two nodes.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  Fig. 4. When a novel is closer to the “high school” node, that means that it is more commonly asked for in high school syllabi."
