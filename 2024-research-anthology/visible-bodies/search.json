The project owes the large part of its metadata creation to Emily Huang, Visible Bodies’ 2024 CESTA intern. Amanda Cheng and Delaney Swinton completed the accessioning process and initiated the creation of the digital exhibit, with Amanda implementing interactive features and polishing the text as it stands today.\n      \n      \n      \n\n      \n  \n  Beginning the Project\n  \n  Delaney Swinton\n  \n  The start of this summer began with the completion of metadata. Regina’s archive contains about 1200 files. Emily Huang, the project’s previous CESTA intern, had already generated metadata for the majority of these files, and so Amanda and I were only left with the last few hundred. Later in the project, when we needed to find a specific letter to draw information from, having an intimate understanding of the categorization of source IDs and metadata based on file attributes would prove extremely helpful.\n  \n  \n  \n  Figure 1. Photograph of Regina and Dan Twala, photographer unknown.\n  \n  \n  After we submitted all of the metadata for accessioning at Stanford Libraries, the next step lay in creating the Spotlight exhibit itself. We began with the text, word-searching through all of Regina’s letters for references to specific Black Johannesburg institutions of her time - the Bantu Men’s Social Center, the Bantu Sports Club, Jan Hofmeyr School for Social Work, among others. We made note of every relevant letters’ source ID according to the subject, so that I could organize these primary sources for archival view in the Spotlight. We then crafted relevant explanatory paragraphs for the exhibit portion of the site, drawing from Regina’ archive and outside secondary sources to paint a fuller picture of these seminal institutions.\n  \n  \n  Creating the Spotlight\n  \n  Amanda Cheng\n  \n  Once we had drafted the preliminary text of the exhibit, I began to fine-tune our content and implement visual features into the Spotlight (at this point, Delaney had transferred projects). I culled through the photographs in Regina’s archive, searching for photos of the institutions that the site details. Additionally, I geographically centered the site by mapping these institutions onto a 1951 tourist map of Johannesburg, so that viewers could gain a sense of the extremely close proximity within which these institutions existed.\n  \n  \n  \n  Figure 2. A map of seminal Black Johannesburg institutions in the mid 20th century, institutions of which Dan was an especially key figure.\n  \n  \n  Once the metadata was accessioned, I was able to draw from my previous categorization of the archive to allow viewers to see all the original letters relating to the relevant exhibit information. All of these features aim to make the Spotlight exhibit more multifaceted and more engaging for viewers.\n  \n  \n  \n  Figure 3. The current home page of the Regina Gelana Twala Digital Archive Spotlight exhibition.\n  \n  \n  Some of the most salient skills I’ve learned from this project are various methods of displaying information to create a particular curated experience. In order to meld the vast archive with the front-facing text, I incorporated particularly relevant photos and quotations as elements of the exhibit. In addition, I geographically centered the various location-based pages through a reproduced map of Johannesburg. I anticipate that these skills will prove extremely helpful in future research that I will engage in, and also in the development of my own personal projects."
