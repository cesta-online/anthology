Out of 825 texts from these libraries, there were 211 total digitized renditions that I could source for the project.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  Library\n  Number of Manuscripts\n  Number of Digitized Manuscripts\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  Paris BN\n  464\n  44\n  \n  \n  Leiden UB\n  47\n  1\n  \n  \n  Amsterdam EHB\n  235\n  139\n  \n  \n  Madrid BN\n  64\n  14\n  \n  \n  Kunitachi HitUL\n  15\n  13\n  \n  \n  \n  Initially, there were struggles with sourcing these manuscripts, from a linguistic level. For instance, producing editions with modified or romanized titles was a popular practice. Additionally, some publishers reproduced manuscripts into multiple parts, and so tracking each individual part proved to be a difficult task. However, as I grew accustomed to linguistic conventions and took initiative to learn key phrases, I was able to effectively source the manuscripts.\n  \n  \n  \n  Fig. 1. This is a French manuscript from the Ars Mercatoria Catalog, describing a sociological perspective on the persecution of Christians in Japan, written by the famous merchant and traveler Jean-Baptiste Tavernier.\n  \n  \n  I then systematically organized these manuscripts by geographic region and recorded detailed metadata, including library of origin, publication date, publisher, and author. Additionally, I created catalogues of author and publisher relationships for each library, in order to highlight the connections between individuals.\n  \n  \n  \n  Fig. 2. This is a breakdown of the number of manuscripts that are housed in each country across the Globe.\n  \n  \n  A few interesting trends were brought to light: some authors published for themselves; others sought out the same publisher for all of the bookâ€™s editions. To better illustrate this, I then created an interactive data visualization of author-publisher relationships from Amsterdam EHB, since it had the most complete meta-data out of all the libraries.\n  \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  Fig. 3. This is a network graph depicting the connections between authors and publishers of manuscripts housed in the Amsterdam EHB library.\n  Overall, this summer was focused on sourcing the data needed to glean insights on the networks and processes that contributed to the spread of commercial knowledge in Europe."
