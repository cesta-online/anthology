The building was photographed extensively in the late 19th century, and throughout the 20th, with the pre-1907 images being the most valuable, as they show details of the now lost upper structure. This project aims to reimagine and reconstruct the original appearance of the kiosk, and a newly excavated structure to its west, using a combination of methodological and evidentiary approaches. The research is based on the close study of the earliest recorded drawings and photographs of the building, alongside the extant material remains in museums across the world, as well as the in-situ structural elements.\n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n          Project Members\n        \n        \n          \n            Project Member\n          \n          \n            Designation\n          \n          \n            ORCID\n          \n        \n            \n          \n            Patricia Blessing\n          \n          \n            Associate Professor of Art and Art History\n          \n          0000-0000-0000-0000\n        \n            \n          \n            Tasmia Arthi\n          \n          \n            Intern - Summer, 2024\n          \n          0000-0000-0000-0000\n        \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n  \n  Reconstructing the Past in Virtual Reality: Digitally Reviving the Qilij Arslan II Kiosk in Konya\n  \n  Tasmia Arthi\n  \n  This summer, I have been working on the digital reconstruction of the Qilij Arslan II Kiosk in Konya, a late twelfth-century monument that was largely destroyed in the early twentieth century. My work focused on creating a 3D model that could be experienced both on screen and in virtual reality (VR). My primary tool for this project was Unity, a powerful game development engine that I needed to learn from scratch.\n  \n  \n  \n  Figure 1. The Qilij Arslan II Kiosk before the collapse of the upper structure, and a digital drawing of what it might have looked like before destruction.\n  \n  \n  Initially, I faced the challenge of understanding Unity’s interface and capabilities, particularly how to translate architectural designs into a digital format. This involved mastering the basics of 3D modeling, including manipulating vertices, edges, and faces to craft accurate representations of the kiosk’s intricate features. I spent a significant amount of time experimenting with different modeling techniques to ensure that the digital structure would faithfully reflect the original architecture.\n  One of the most critical aspects of my work was ensuring that the 3D model was not only visually accurate but also compatible with VR. For this, I used Unity’s VR development tools, learning how to optimize the model for performance in a virtual environment. I had to consider how users would interact with the space, adjusting scale and detail to create an immersive experience that felt true to the historical context of the kiosk. Throughout this process, I was figuring out how to reduce the polygon count without losing essential details, ensuring that the lighting in the virtual environment mimicked natural light sources as they would have appeared in the original structure.\n  \n  \n  \n  Figure 2. 3D reconstruction of the Kiosk within Unity software.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  Figure 1: Figure 3. Video of the 3D reconstruction of the kiosk.\n  \n  \n  \n  Additionally, I explored various texture mapping techniques to replicate the materials and finishes typical of Islamic architecture. This involved researching historical references, such as examples of tiles and stucco panels dating to the same period as the building, and experimenting with different shaders in Unity to achieve a balance between realism and performance.\n  \n  \n  \n  Figure 4. Texture mapping of the kiosk inspired by the archeological materials available.\n  \n  \n  My work on this project has not only expanded my technical skills but also deepened my appreciation for the complexity of historical architecture and the challenges of bringing it to life in a digital space. Overall, this experience has been a rewarding blend of learning and creativity, as I’ve worked to build a digital model that serves both as a tool for education and a means of preserving cultural heritage."
