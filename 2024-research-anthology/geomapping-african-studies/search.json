I started my process by discussing the project with my faculty leads to clearly understand its scope and objectives. We decided to utilize ArcGIS web-based mapping software to effectively visualize the data and create a geo-map.\n  In the first half of the summer, my workflow had been heavily focused on data collection and compilation. I began by compiling a comprehensive list of Stanford students and affiliated faculty members involved in Africa-related research and initiatives. Then I identified various data sources, including department websites, research centers, and academic publications. From those multiple sources, I thoroughly reviewed and verified detailed information about scholars and research activities, then compiled and organized a total of 284 entries into a centralized database for further visualization. To ensure the accuracy and completeness of the database, I reached out to individuals and relevant departments to verify the information and conduct thorough data cleaning and validation.\n  Once the data was compiled, I transitioned to developing the geo-map by designing the layout and features. With assistance from specialists at the Stanford Geospatial Center, I became acquainted with ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Pro software, which allowed me to successfully develop the interactive map. I georeferenced each entry on my database with the base map by its corresponding spatial coordinates according to the researched region. I further enhanced the interface by incorporating search and filter functions, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly interface and functionality.\n  In the final phase of the project, I was responsible for embedding the geo-map, our final data visualization product, into the Stanford Center for African Studies website. In addition to integrating the map and customizing the website’s interface, I also managed the website and updated its content to reflect the latest information. By centralizing information and streamlining access, this project strongly endorses ongoing research and activities but also serves as a valuable resource for identifying collaboration opportunities, fostering partnerships across departments, and bringing more awareness to Africa-focused initiatives. Furthermore, because of the project’s sustainability and accessibility, it offers flexible opportunities for extending its use by expanding its geographical and contextual coverage.\n  This geo-map provides a comprehensive overview of Stanford University’s research activities across the African continent. It highlights the diverse range of projects undertaken by both faculty and students, illustrating the university’s commitment to addressing global challenges through innovative research. By visualizing the geographic distribution of these efforts, the map underscores the breadth and impact of Stanford’s academic contributions in Africa, from environmental studies and public health to social sciences and technology. Explore the map to gain insight into how Stanford’s research is fostering meaningful partnerships and driving progress in various regions of Africa."
