Syriac is now primarily a liturgical language, but previously it was a prevalent western dialect of Aramaic in which many important early Christian texts in the Middle East were Written. The first project entailed comparing two collections containing descriptions of hundreds of Syriac manuscripts from various libraries and catalogs, and figuring out which ones have yet to be published. I also had to collect data such as the contents of the manuscript, where the information was located, and which specific pages had yet to be published. The second project entailed looking at a database of digitized manuscripts published by the Vatican, and collecting data such as the page dimensions of the manuscript, the date or era of publication, what kind of manuscript it was and its purpose, as well as the material of the manuscript. The third project was following up with manuscripts still in the Middle East in a similar manner with the Vatican manuscripts to record both physical and content related data about them that have yet to be collected. Throughout the summer I worked with well over 1000+ manuscripts.\n  \n  \n  \n  Fig. 1. A page from Catalogue of Syriac Manuscripts in the British Museum Acquired Since the Year 1838\n  \n  \n  All of these data points were logged into three different spreadsheets, one for the unpublished manuscripts data, one containing data regarding the Vatican manuscripts, and the last one for the manuscripts still in the Middle East. Then, it was time to familiarize myself with Tableau, a software for data analysis and creating both static and interactive data visualizations, to use the data I collected to analyze interesting trends and patterns regarding the manuscripts I was given to clean the data of. Perhaps there is a certain period in which many manuscripts are unpublished, or it appears that a certain size of manuscript is much rarer than another. I am also working with previous visualizations from past interns and updating them as well as creating my own.\n  \n  \n  \n  Fig. 2.

More people will continue to add to the data and work with my metadata to figure out which ones are of greater importance to publish. The last part of my summer included some research on quantitative codicology (the archaeology of the book) to help the continuing problem of data categorization and organization of new digital libraries."
