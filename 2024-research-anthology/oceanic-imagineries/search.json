My work this summer involved creating a digital map of these islands with a searchable online repository of relevant contemporary and archival materials and virtual tours of several locations. For the purposes of this pilot project, we limited the scope to 21 islands, which fall into three general clusters: the Prince Edward Islands; Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha; and the islands adjacent to the South African coast.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  Fig. 1. Map of the uMzantsi islands, highlighting three general island clusters.\n  With the exception of Saint Helena and Robben Island, easily accessible information on these islands is quite limited. Moreover, the islands are often regarded separately. Few resources bring to light the many similarities and connections between their cultural and environmental histories. The purpose of this project was to create a central scholarly resource on these islands that highlights these linked historical narratives and houses a digital collection of maps, academic articles, historical photographs, government reports, and other relevant material. We additionally sought to create virtual field trips using geotagged 360° photographs, which allow users to inhabit and move through these remote and largely inaccessible spaces.\n  Working closely with South African researcher Adrienne van Eeden-Wharton, who actively gathered the materials for the project and took contemporary photographs, panoramas, and videos, I created a web application using ArcGIS Experience Builder. While I initially used ArcGIS StoryMaps and Instant Apps, I found these software too restrictive in both design and functionality, so I transitioned to Experience Builder, which offered greater flexibility and the potential to further customize app features using JavaScript and React. I worked with a sample selection of materials on Marion Island to develop a streamlined process for integrating and presenting resources that can be easily scaled as additional content is added.\n  The web application has four main pages. The first is the landing page, which introduces the project and explains how to use the application. The second is a story map page that describes each island and the cross-island themes with an accompanying dynamic map of the islands that pans, zooms, and morphs with the narrative. The third page features the virtual field trips. I used ThingLink to convert our 360° panoramas into immersive photospheres and link them in space alongside flat panoramas and other materials. The fourth page displays all of the geotagged resources in a grid format. Users can curate a narrower selection by searching the collection, filtering by the metadata (subject, date, etc.), or using the map tool to trace the area they are interested in.\n  \n  \n  \n  Fig. 2.

The All Resources page of the Experience Builder web application, featuring a grid of digitized materials on the left and an interactive map with geotagged locations on the right.\n  \n  \n  The next steps are to expand this project beyond Marion Island, which involves collating and organizing materials on the other islands and integrating them into the Experience Builder display. When completed, this project will provide a comprehensive and interactive resource for scholars and the public alike, enabling virtual exploration of the islands and research that illuminates key intersections across their cultural and environmental histories."
