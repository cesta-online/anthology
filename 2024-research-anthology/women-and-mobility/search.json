I started by determining what data is currently missing for the 955 female Grand Tour travelers recorded in the Explorer database. We aimed to create a framework to answer the question: what can the presence and absence of data tell us about the cultural context of women and mobility in the 18th century? The nature of my work was mainly exploratory since this was the first time we took a much closer look at the female entries.\n  For the first part of this project, I mainly focused on reworking the datasheets using R by adding new dimensions (or columns) Professor Ceserani wanted to explore, such as relationships between women travelers (which I subdivided in: Mother-Daughter, Sisters, Aunt-Niece, Employer-Employee, In-Laws, and Non-Related Co-Travelers, Other) and name type (that is the variations in available information about data in the Explorer for women, which include Only First Name, First and Last, First Middle Last, Mrs/Miss/Mme, Multiple, Sister of, Daughter of, Mother of, Companion, Niece, Aunt, Servant). I then utilized the ggplot package in R to create visualizations depicting missing information in various ways. In the anthology, I have included visualizations that depict missing information for various biographical dimensions (consisting of birth date, birthplace, death date, death place, and parents) over time. However, throughout the project, I made visualizations that included overall missing information ratios, missing biographical information by visit information, name type ratios, and more.\n  \n  \n  \n  Fig. 1. This graph shows the percentage of present data throughout the 18th cent. for women. The most present data was for parent, death date, and death place information.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  Fig. 2. This graph shows again the percentage of present data for women, but the triangle represents previously existing entries, while the circle those created by the project for newly uncovered travelers. We can see that less is known for the previously existing ones.\n  \n  \n  Afterward, I focused on creating interactive network graphs using Flourish to showcase the relationships among these women. For the sake of readability and comparison, I created a graph for non-related co-travelers, related travelers, and other relationships (unknown and unique). Finally, I went back to R to create the same visualizations for male travelers to attempt to answer our initial question via comparative analysis.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  Fig. 3. This graph shows the percentage of present data throughout the 18th cent. for men. The most present data was parent, death date, and birth date.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  Fig. 4. This graph shows again the percentage of present data for men, but the triangle represents previously existing entries, while the circle those created by the project for newly uncovered travelers. We know significantly more about parents for newly created entries."
