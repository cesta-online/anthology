        <h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Welcome to the <span style="color: var(--cesta-plum);">CESTA Research Anthology <i>Online</i></span></h1>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1em;">The CESTA Research Anthology is an annual publication which showcases the work of our many vibrant research projects, as presented by our undergraduate research interns.</p>
        <p>Every year, several dozen Stanford undergraduates from a broad range of majors and minors join the CESTA community as research interns. Over one or more quarters, these interns collaborate with faculty and graduate students on cutting-edge research in the digital humanities. The capstone for our interns is the submission of a research report under the supervision of their project leads. The Anthology brings together these reports, offering a student's-eye view on the work that's been accomplished at CESTA over the course of the year. 
        </p>
        <p>Previous versions of the CESTA Research Anthology can be found on the CESTA main website, <a href="https://cesta.stanford.edu/publications-all/anthology">here</a>.</p>
        <p>With CESTA Research Anthology Online, students have the opportunity to share their work in interactive format. We will continue printing our annual Research Anthology.</p>
